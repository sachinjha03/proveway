## 💖 Special Thanks

Thank you for taking the time to check out this project!  
I built this interface **entirely from scratch**, without using any third-party website builders or UI libraries. Every line of code—from layout to functionality—was written manually to ensure complete understanding and control over the final result.

Your feedback, suggestions, and stars ⭐ on GitHub are always appreciated!
